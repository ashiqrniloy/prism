name: create-plan
description: Create and maintain numbered plan documents for work that requires documenting executable task lists. Use anytime a user asks an agent to create, write, update, execute, or maintain any plan, including an implementation plan, roadmap, task breakdown, phase plan, project plan, or plan document with objectives, expected outcomes, acceptance criteria, approaches, tests, compromises, and follow-up actions.

# Create Plan

Create or update actionable, numbered, documentation-backed implementation plans in `plans/` at the repository root.

## Plan Creation Workflow

1. Determine the repository root: Git root if available, otherwise current working directory.
2. Ensure `plans/` exists.
3. Choose the next filename by incrementing the highest existing three-digit prefix, e.g. `001-Setup.md`, `002-Window-Creation.md`.
4. Read current docs for relevant libraries, frameworks, SDKs, packages, crates, CLIs, or services. Prefer project-local docs, then documentation lookup tools. Record exact docs/API references in the plan.
5. If `.agents/skills/project-patterns/` exists, use it before writing task approaches and cite relevant pattern files.
6. For phase implementation plans that add or change an editor mode, language mode, JS package, extension point, or reusable capability, include a dedicated primitive-review task before implementation. The task must inventory existing primitives, document what can be achieved with them, plan only generic reusable new primitives when required, and then build package/mode functionality on top of those primitives.
7. Load project-specific plan requirements deterministically:
   - Read `.agents/skills/create-plan/references/default.md` if it exists.
   - Read `.agents/skills/create-plan/references/<git-root-basename>.md` if it exists.
   - Read `.agents/skills/create-plan/references/prism-wiki.md` if it exists.
   - Apply all loaded requirements before finalizing tasks.
8. If `.agents/skills/project-wiki/` exists, include exactly one final code-wiki task after implementation/verification and project-specific maintenance tasks. Use `.agents/skills/create-plan/references/wiki-task.md` when present.
9. Write the plan using the structure below.

## Required Plan Structure

```markdown
# <Plan Title>

## Objectives
- <Objective 1>
- <Objective 2>

## Expected Outcome
- <Observable deliverable or behavior>
- <System state after completion>

## Tasks

- [ ] <Task title>
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Functional: <task-specific behavior>
    - Performance: <latency/resource/scale/non-regression expectation>
    - Code Quality: <maintainability/architecture/typing/linting/error-handling expectation>
    - Security: <safety/validation/permissions/secrets/dependency expectation>
  - Approach:
    - Documentation Reviewed:
      - <docs, versions, sections, URLs, or tool references>
    - Options Considered:
      - <Option and tradeoff>
      - <Option and tradeoff>
    - Chosen Approach:
      - <why this approach fits>
    - API Notes and Examples:
      ```<language>
      <minimal relevant API example or command>
      ```
    - Files to Create/Edit:
      - `<path>`: <planned change>
    - References:
      - <docs, code paths, examples, decisions, issues, or patterns>
  - Test Cases to Write:
    - <test/scenario>: <what it validates>
  - Documentation/Wiki Assessment:
    - Public API or behavior impacted: <yes/no and why>
    - Docs pages to create/edit:
      - `<path>`: <planned documentation change, or `none` with reason>
    - `docs/index.md` update: <yes/no and navigation entry>
    - Documentation structure reference: <reference file or reason not applicable>

## Compromises Made
- To be filled after tasks are completed and tests pass.

## Further Actions
- To be filled after task completion with improvements, rationale, and priority.
```

## Task Writing Rules

- Make every task independently checkable with `- [ ]` or `- [x]`.
- Keep acceptance criteria specific; include functional, performance, code quality, and security criteria for every task.
- Treat `Approach` as mandatory and evidence-based.
- Include documentation-derived API examples for library/framework/SDK/package/crate/CLI/service usage.
- For new JS packages or mode implementations, add a primitive-first task before package work: read primitive docs/wiki, assess existing Rust-side primitives, identify generic primitive gaps, reject mode-specific Rust logic, and include tests/docs so the primitive library becomes easier to reuse for later modes.
- List every expected file. If uncertain, mark the list tentative and explain why.
- Write test cases before implementation, derived from acceptance criteria.
- Every task must include a `Documentation/Wiki Assessment`; if it adds or changes a public API, extension point, configuration surface, protocol, event, registry, provider/tool/session behavior, or package subpath, plan matching `/docs` updates and a `docs/index.md` navigation update.
- Apply loaded project-specific requirements before finalizing the task list.
- Do not fill `Compromises Made` or `Further Actions` before execution unless known constraints already exist.

## Deterministic Execution Loop

When executing a plan:

1. Read the full plan.
2. Select the first unchecked task unless the user names a specific task.
3. Implement only the selected task unless dependencies require a small, explicitly noted prerequisite.
4. Run the task's listed tests/checks and any directly relevant validation.
5. Update the task checkbox to `- [x]` only after implementation and checks pass.
6. If the approach, files, or tests changed, update that task before continuing.
7. Repeat from step 2 until implementation and verification tasks are complete.
8. Run final verification for the plan.
9. Fill `Compromises Made` and `Further Actions` with actual deviations, deferred work, rationale, and priority.
