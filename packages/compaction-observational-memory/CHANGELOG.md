## [0.0.6] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Added validated hard-capped worker turns, per-turn/total calls, arguments, results, transcript, and surfaced-error limits.
- Unknown/excess tool calls and oversized/deep/cyclic values now fail deterministically before provider replay; provider/tool/runtime errors and replayed results are bounded and known-secret redacted.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-07-16

- Pinned the required `@arnilo/prism` peer and package metadata to 0.0.5; runtime behavior is unchanged.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Worker transcripts remain provider-valid across rounds; revision/source redaction and bounded ledger/status/recall behavior are documented and release-gated.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Added `LICENSE` (MIT) and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added npm package metadata: `license`, `repository`, `bugs`, `homepage`,
  `keywords`, and `sideEffects`.

### Changed

- `files` whitelist now explicitly excludes `dist/__tests__/` and
  `dist/**/*.map` from published tarballs.
- Made `prism` a required peer dependency; it is no longer optional.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added
