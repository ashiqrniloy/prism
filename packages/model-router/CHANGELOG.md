# Changelog

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-13

### Changed
- Atomic model-budget reservation (reserve/commit/release with fencing tokens, TTL expiry and unknown-usage reconciliation), rate/budget key-map caps with LRU eviction that never drops a held-reservation row, and admission rewired to reserve-at-admission (readBudget/addUsage stay for cap-less requests and retrospective accounting). See docs/migration.md 0.2.1 → 0.2.2 and docs/model-routing.md.
