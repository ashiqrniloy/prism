# Memory benchmark: beam-100k / full-truncated

Status: completed. Input: 5817575; cache read: 5418880; ratio: 0.9315.
Attempt: 202-baseline.beam-100k.full-truncated.hyper.qwen3.8-27b@1; usage complete: true; resumed results: 0.
Tool calls: 0 (0.00/q); recall calls: 0; snippet tokens: 0; recall@k: n/a.
Judge: hyper/glm-5.3-flash. Truncated questions: 0. Metric version: 2.
Phase: all. Timing: arm 302174.6 ms at concurrency 8 (initial 8); questions p50 59583.8 ms / p95 87326 ms; judge 78x p50 1951.9ms, solver 40x p50 13577.6ms.

Judge accuracy and token F1 are separate metrics. Answer-session hit@k is a coarse any-round boolean;
evidence coverage is round-level and all-required evidence coverage is a separate constraint. Fine-gold
recall/precision stay n/a when the dataset does not expose usable fine gold.
